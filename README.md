Orlando Magic Social Center Rough Template #1
This is the rough draft template for the Social Center Project for the Web Developer position for the Orlando Magic.

There are still edits and changes I would need to make, if this was a real project, mostly visual and fine tuning some of the pages but the general design and ideas are here.
I did have to trim the video down in order to upload it but it doesn't really make a difference.
